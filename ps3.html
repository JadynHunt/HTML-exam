        <li class="info"><p>The <i>Playstation 3</i> was released in Japan on November 11, 2006 and reached the U.S a week later on November 17th. It reached Europe and Asia on March 23, 2007. Sega didn’t have a console to compete, so the <i>Playstation 3’s</i> only competition was the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii. It was the console to incorporate Blu-ray technology as its main storage component. It also was the first console to add online multiplayer (through Playstation Network) and include an HDMI port. There are several versions of the <i>Playstation 3</i>: the original, the slim (released in 2009), and the superslim (released in 2012). The slim and superslim were lighter, more compact versions of the <i>Playstation 3</i>. Also, the <i>Playstation 3</i> was the console to introduce a portable version in the PSP (PlayStation Portable) and the PSVita. On release the console was viewed negatively because of its expensive prices of $599 - $499. However, fans soon realized that the console was worth its price. The graphics and output became even more complex and players were able to play with friends while in separate locations for the first time. The manufacturing of the <i>Playstation 3</i> was discontinues on May 29, 2017. It sold 87.4 million units worldwide.</p></li>
