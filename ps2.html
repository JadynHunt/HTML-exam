            <li class="info"><p>The <i>Playstation 2</i> was released in Japan on March 4th, 2000, shortly before the end of the creation of its predecessor the Playstation 1. It reached the U.S. in October of 2000. It’s Competition was Sega’s Dreamcast, the Xbox, and the GameCube. The hype from the Playstation one helped the spread of this console. <i>The Playstation 2</i> had a major upgrade in technology which made it almost completely different from the first Playstation. The <i>Playstation 2</i> could not only run both new games and old games from the Playstation 1, but it could also play DVD movies. Also, companies were able to make more complex games because of the new video output and resolutions. This allowed games to have better graphics which made them more vibrant and realistic. These new features excited fans so everyone wanted a <i>Playstation 2</i> when it released which is why it is the most sold console to date with over 155 million units sold worldwide. On release the <i>Playstation 2</i> priced at $299, but in May of 2002 the price was lowered to $199. That made it the same price as the GameCube and cheaper than the Xbox, which boosted the sales even more. Sony continued to manufacture the console all the way until 2013.</p></li>
