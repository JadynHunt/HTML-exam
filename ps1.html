        <Li class="info"><p>The <i>Playstation</i> is the first of Sony’s game console series and was released in 1994 in japan and was not spread to other parts of the world ( North America, Europe, and Australia)  until September of 1995. Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive, is responsible for the idea and creation of the <i>Playstation</i> so he was later called “The Father of Playstation”. The console had competition with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. In the year 2000 the <i>Playstation</i>  was redesigned and was replaced by the <i>Playstation 1</i> . The number 1 was added to the title so that the public didn’t confuse it as the second PlayStation (Playstation 2). One of the features of the <i>Playstation 1</i> that made it so popular, is the console’s use of compact discs (CDs). Most game consoles at this time used cartridges. This console boosted Sony as a company and when they allowed third-party companies to make games for their console it boosted their popularity even more. The <i>Playstation 1<i/> became the very first console to sell and ship 100 million units. The creation of the first <i>Playstation</i> ended on March 23, 2006.</p></Li>
